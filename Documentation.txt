AWP instead of sniper rifle. Mind the orientation and correct ratio when changing image. 256x512 for rifles.

The texture must be saved in the same location, as it is saved in the game. Also look for parent (e.g. humanmakablegun).

First try: image was not wide enough so the texture looked stretched and colonists pointed awp at themselves. Absolute chonker.
